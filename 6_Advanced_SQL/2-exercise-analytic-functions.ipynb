Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n","- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017.\n","- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 15 days and the following 15 days, as long as the days fit within the two-year time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 5, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 4 days, the current date, and the following 15 days.\n","\n","This query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.
